Detection and classification of handwriten numbers for automatic naming and filing of documents using Neural Networks

Project under development

Using state-of-the-art MNIST Neural networks, the aim of this project is to be able to extract the serial number and model from scanned documents to automate its naming and digital filing.

The objetive fields in the document are detected using OCR techniques, and the numbers are detected using contour detection.
